**New subminor version version::``1.0.3-beta``:** see the small useful new fetaures below.


**Tables for proofs.**

    1) The environnement ``demotab`` has a new option ``cwidth`` to indicate the width of the central column.

    1) The environnements ``demotab`` and ``demotab*`` propose a new macro ``demoxspace`` that allows to modify locally the height of a line (no global setting for the moment).

    1) The macro ``\explnothing`` allows to indicate explicitly that nothing is needed in a cell.

    1) The documentation has been updated with examples emphasing the different ways to indicate empty cells.

**New sub minor version version::``1.0.2-beta``:** see the small big change below.


**Logic:** the decoration of the symbols is a little bigger now.

**New sub minor version version::``1.0.1-beta``:** see the changes below with some backward incompatibilities.


**Logic:** there is only two symbolic symbols for the macros ``\eq*`` and ``\neq*`` (definition and identitity).

**New major version version::``1.0.0-beta``:** see the changes below with some backward incompatibilities.


**Calculations and demonstration step by step:** here are all the changes.

    1) The environment ``demoexplain`` becomes ``demotab``.

    1) The environment ``explain`` becomes ``stepcalc``.

    1) The new environment ``stepcalc`` has also a new style ``ar*`` that puts all operators in the margin for better formattings.

    1) One bug fixed: there were bad spacings with the style ``ar`` for step by step calculations (this was just because of ``&#1`` instead of ``#1&``...).


**Logic:** here are all the changes.

    1) ``\liesimp`` has been renamed ``\becauseof`` (the macro ``\because`` already exists).

    1) The way to decorate comparison and logical operators has changed: the corresponding macros have all an optional argument to give any text.

    1) The star version of the macros can produce new symbolic symbols in some rare cases: the macros ``\eq*`` and ``\neq*`` are the only that do that for the moment.
